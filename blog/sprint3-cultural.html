      <h3>Difference Between IQ and EQ</h2>
      <p>
        IQ (intelligence quotient) is defined as the ability to understand and apply information to a given challenge. EQ (Emotional Quotient) is defined as the ability to identify and manage one’s emotions and others emotions around himself. IQ is more about understanding and utilising skills such as typing speed, problem solving, etc. Whereas EQ is more focused around understanding and affecting people (including one’s self).

      <h3>Importance of Emotional Intelligence</h3>
      <p>
        Emotional intelligence has been a common trait found in High level executives. The ability to understand your own and others mental states makes it much easier to be able to traverse a workplace environment. Understanding yourself is important as if you do not address certain issues within yourself, they can surface later on in more negative ways. This has been referred to as understanding your shadow in Jungian archetypes. It is also important to understand other people’s mental states as you will be able to interact with them better. By having good EQ you can stop miss communication and disagreements from arising.
