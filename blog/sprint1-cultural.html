    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>An intro into who I am</h2>

      <h3>Core ethical values</h2>
      <p>
        Hi guys my name is David I am located in wellington, heres a little story to show you some of my core values. There was a situation when my friends wanted to get food and waste time but I had an assignment due. I weighed up the consequence of not completing the assignment versus a KFC bucket and decided not to go. This showed that I always stick to what I believe and that I never rush into peer pressure as a bucket of KFC is a tempting offer.

I constantly self evaluate to make sure I am on top of my mental state. When I make a bad judgement call based on my ego I try and recognise it, I can then reflect on how to stop it from happening again and better improve myself. I also try and recognise bad habbits and apply the same method, an example for this is eating too much junk food.

      <h3>Cultural influences</h2>
      <p>
        I have not been acustomed to much of my polynesian side until recently. My cousins were helpfull enough to tell me about the polynesian culture. I have been looking into a lot of the history and religious ideologies that the polynesian people had and found that their customs were more based around respect, acknowledgement of the ancestors and philosophical/spirital practices. My main influence for most of my life has been from NZ and european culture but learning about my other side has made me want to explore the polynesian culture.

      <h3>Strengths</h3>

      <p>
        One of my strengths is strong mental willpower, an example of this is when I did a fast for 7 days. My friends can attest to this willpower as they witness these events. Another strength is Logical thinking, I find it really easy to process logical information once I have familiarised myself with the contents. For example I picked up using git within a day and am now comfortable staging, commiting and pushing to a remote repository. The last strength I would like to bring up is my good memory. This may be partly due to the fact that in samoan culture all history and information was stored in the brain as they did not usually write down things due to the oral nature of the societey.

      <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
      <img class="image-2_1" src="../images/Merkaba.png" alt="eye of Egypt">
      <p>I find that times I can be too logical sometimes missing an implication that may be obvious. My friends will often make statements where it would be pretty obvious what they were talking about but I would be sitting there clueless. This is not so bad now as I have been actively changing the way I think to include more abstract thought. Time management is a place I have struggled with before, but more recently I have been working on it and have been sticking to a more consistent scheduel.
