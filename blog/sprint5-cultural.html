    <h1>Reflection</h1>
    <h2>Looking back</h2>
    <h3>5 March 2021</h3>
    <div class="content_1">
      <h3>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h3>
      <p>
        I have learned that I need to focus more of my time on a meditative practice as I notice it helps me stay more 
        focused when studying. My ego tends to act like it doesn’t need to practice meditation but I think it is necessary.
        Without a consistent schedule there is not way to stop overburning.
      </p>
      
    </div>
    
    <div class="content_2">
        <h3>What is the role of values, empathy and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
        <p>
            Values give you a sense of purpose to why you are coding and helps you develop yourself better to interact with other
            co-workers. Empathy allows you to be human and makes sure you don’t become a robot reading 1’s and 0’s. self-awareness
            keeps you in control of what you are doing making sure you do not lose track of your values and course during your 
            coding career. Self control is important to be able to drive forward in this course and complete it with a high degree 
            of standard. There will be plenty of opportunites to get distracted so staying disiplined will help complete this course.
        </p>
        <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
        <p>
            The good work life balance guide surprised me as I was not expecting there to be a guide on how to manage wellbeing and productivity.
        </p>


        <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
        <p>
            Setting up a regular schedule to meditate, as I am not used to a schedule and tend to do things sporadically.
        </p>

        <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3>
        <p>
            Because these are the skills employers want from their staff. This is what makes you stand out from other applicants.
        </p>

        <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
        <p>
            I think that it is important to be able to develop your people skills. Most people now days spend too much time on the theory and forget that a work environment requires you 
            to interact with other people on the daily. Learning how to stay mentally and physically healthy is just as important as learning how to code.
