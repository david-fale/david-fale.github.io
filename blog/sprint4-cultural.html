    <h1>Neuroplasticity</h1>
    <h2>Understanding The Mind</h2>
    <h3>23 February 2021</h3>
    <div class="content_1">
      <h3>Why Understand Neuroplasticity</h3>
      <p>
        Neuroplasticity is the ability for the brain to develop new connections. In simple terms the ability to
        learn. Understanding Neuroplasticity has shown to improve learning ability. Psychologist Carol Dweck 
        talks about trials they have done with school childeren showing how teachning them about Neuroplasticity
        increases learning ability. This may be due to the fact the kids have more motivation as barrieres are 
        broken down, or it could be they know how to properly tackle hard problems.
      </p>
      <h3>How can I utilise understanding Neuroplasticity?</h3>
      <p>
        I use what I have learned about neuroplasticity to help me learn smarter not harder. If I understand
        that the brain is malleable I can tackle difficult situations by breaking them down into smaller tasks
        and using more effort for those smaller tasks. I can use repetition to keep what I have learned in my 
        long term memory. Thinking from another view point may be helpful in increasing my neuroplasticity as 
        you have a better understanding on the challenge ahead of you. For example instead of trying to brute 
        force a coding challenge I could take a step back from the problem and try look for an alternative path
        than the currnet strategy. This makes it more effective than just trying the same way as even if the new
        perspective doesnt work you have activated more of your brain trying that new angle of attack.
      </p>
      <h3>Ways to increase neuroplasticity</h3>
      <p>
        Neroplasticity can be increased by knowing the brain is able to be changed. Using repetition can strengthen
        the connections in your brain making it easier to recall the information you have learned. Using lions mane
        has shown to strengthen the myelin sheath which is responsilbe for improving neural conductivity in your brain
        (simmilar to how a rubber coating on a wire stops a current from leaving the wire). In simple terms stronger myelin
        sheath leads to better memory. here is a video that goes into good depth on the subject.

      <h3>Growth Mindset</h3>
      <p>
        Growth mindset is understanding that you can learn anything with a good strategy and that the brain is not fixed in
        learning capacity. The only limit is yourself. This is important because knowing that you can learn anything means
        that when you come across a hard problem you can formulate a strategy to solve it instead of panicing and thinking you
        are not smart enough to solve it. I will be using this understanding of growth mind set to help me solve complex problems
        more efficently. Instead of trying to force it to work I can look at how I can break it down into small chunks and then solve it.
