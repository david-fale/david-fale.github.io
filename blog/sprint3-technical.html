      <h3>HTML VS CSS</h2>
      <p>
        HTML is like an empty house; it serves a function but does not look that good on its own. CSS is like the furnishings making the house feel like a home.
      </p>
      <h3>Control flow and loops</h2>
      <p>
        control flow statements (if, for, while) are like a tap and the block statements are like the water. Control flow statements tell the block statements when and how long to do something for. Like turning on and off a tap lets you control how much water comes out. These statements allow you to loop your code blocks until a conditional is met. Here is an example: 
        <br>
        <br>1.	If hands dirty then turn on tap
        <br>2. While sink is not full and hands dirty keep tap on
        <br>3.	Else turn off tap
        <br>4.	Dry hands
        
      </p>

      <h3>The DOM</h3>
      <p>
        The DOM stands for Document Object Model. This is the contents of the browser window. The DOM is the gateway to all HTML on the webpage. The DOM has nodes which it interacts with, these can be elements in the webpage. The DOM can be manipulated with JavaScript to change different elements within the web page.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Why interact with the DOM?</h3>
      <p>You might want to interact with the DOM to change the look of your HTML and CSS. For example changing your h1 tags font size. You can do this by using JavaScript to select the element (or node) that is associated with the h1 tags and change its CSS properties. 
      </p>
      
      <h3>Acessing data Arrays</h3>
      <img class="examples" src="../images/arry-example.PNG" alt="array example">
      <p>In the example above we can see how to access data in an array. We use the name of the array (arry) followed by the bracket notation ‘[0]’ with the index (or position) inside the array we want to access. In this example we want to access the item ‘apple’. Since apple is the first item in the array we simply use ‘arry[0]’ to access it (as the index starts at 0 not 1). </p>

      
      <h3>Margin</h3>
      <img class="examples" src="../images/obj-example.PNG" alt="object example"> 

      <p>To access data from an object we can use bracket or dot notation. I.e. ‘car.color’  or ‘car[“color”]’. In the example above we use ‘car.color’ and this returns us the value ‘red’. This is different from accessing data from an array as we do not need to specify an index, instead we just specify the property we are trying to access.</p>
