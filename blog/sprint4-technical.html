      <h3>Getting Stuck</h3>
      <p>
        There was a time during the Kata's where I got stuck. It was on the Built in Methods on the "whereAreYou"
        function. They wanted you to find all the objects that contained "Scooby" as a value and return the door
        number. To solve this I used the console.log method to see what my code was actually doing and was able
        to eventually find out what I needed to change. This made me really confused at first but after sticking 
        with the task using console.log to see what was happening I started to feel more comfortable with the
        exercise.
      </p>

        <h3>Finding a solution</h3>
        <p>
          In the Repl.it "JS Variables and Objects" I was able to solve the task by reading the error logs. The logs
          gave useful information which allowed me to figure out what I needed to imput in order to solve the problem.
          This made me feel like I was able to complete the task well.
        </p>
        <h3>Confidence on problemsolving techniques</h3>
        <h4>Trying something</h4>
        <p>
          I used this technique alot during this sprint, I found it useful to get an idea of what I needed to put down.
          Although I think I should have used more pseudocode to get familiar with the structure of the code before 
          trying it out.
        </p>
        <h4>Console.logging</h4>
        <p>
            This came to be very useful during this sprint. console.logging allowed me to see what the code I was writing 
            was actually doing. I found that alot of the code I was using was not working correctly using this method
            which allowed me to change it to start functioning properly.
        </p>
        <h4>Googling</h4>
        <p>
            This was probably the most useful out of all the techniques. I was able to find good material on the tasks which
            allowed me to get a good understanding of the functions I was using.
        </p>
        <h3>Overall</h3>
        <p>
            There were deffinitely some areas I need to improve on when it comes to problem solving techniques. Such as 
            pseudocode and asking coaches for help. But overall I would say I did a decent job at using these problem
            solving techniques to finish the katas.
