    <h1>My Learning Plan</h1>
    <h2>How I will manage myself at EDA</h2>
    <h3>13 February 2021</h3>
    <div class="content_1">
      <h3>What is my long term goal?</h3>
      <p>
        My long term goal is to get into the field of cyber security. I will be working towards this over my time at EDA.
      </p>
      <h3>Strengths</h3>
      <p>
        I am good when it comes to logical problems, I have a decent memory and my willpower is strong when I am focused on a goal. These are what makes me strong.
      </p>
      <h3>Weakknesses</h3>
      <p>
        I have a hard time keeping focused and tend to lose track of time. I have been working on this issue by setting time boxes and notifications to keep me on track and focused in the right areas. These are my current limitations.
      </p>

      <h3>How will I manage my workload?</h3>
      <img class="image_background" src="../images/background.png" alt="a circle with patterns">
      <p>
        I will be employing a modified version of the pomedoro technique where I will have longer blocks of work of about 1hr and take a 15 minute break instead of the usual 5 minutes every 25minutes. This gives me time to focus my brain and recover to have a more productive work session, while preventing burnout. I will be breaking the tasks into smaller mini tasks to be able to keep track of progress and prevent me from losing track of the projects wider scope. When it comes to working with other colleagues I will make sure that my workload does not affect them and leaves ample space to organise team meetings.
      </p>
      
      <h3>What will I do when I face a problem?</h3>
      <img class="image_background" src="../images/background_2.png" alt="a circle with patterns">
      <p>
        I will first make sure the solution cannot be learned from google, then I will contact my facilitator at EDA with any concerns/queries that I have. I will also ask team members if they have any solutions to the problems I come into. I expect that the facilitators will give their best efforts to help me when I come across an issue or problem I need help with. I will in return put in my best efforts when it comes to the course.
      </p>

      <p>
        Currently I am able to put in maximum effort during 9am-5pm on week days and will not be able to do any work on weekends due to work.
